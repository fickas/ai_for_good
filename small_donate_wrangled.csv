You might be able to reposition the wire to hear a totally clear connection. For a moment, you can enjoy the music. But even the smallest thing can cause that wire to shift and suddenly you're no longer able to enjoy the music because painful static and white noise are getting in the way. If something causes the wire to shift even further, no music at all will be able to get thru. You can't wait to just turn it off to get away from that loud static! This is similar to life with autism. In some situations a person with autism is able to think clearly and enjoy the moment. But then a small sensory experience can cause the static. Bright lights, people talking in the background, the smell of someone else's snack, their chewing, etc. Too much of this and it feels like the stereo wire is completely frayed. Overload!

Part 2","The student-centered Alternative Learning Program (ALPS) supports and embraces the diverse needs of students by providing a differentiated method of instruction and by supporting the emotional and social needs of students in this special education program. The mission of the ALPS program is to meet the unique educational, social, and emotional needs of our students with emotional disabilities and mental illnesses in a safe and nurturing environment. Most students in this program are from families that fall in the poverty range and have little experience with technology outside of the educational setting.

Mrs.,WA,Grades PreK-2,Math & Science,Environmental Science,Reading About Science!,"My students are part of an innovative program where the focus is building a community that will support each and every learner. Our focus is development of the whole child. Students are encouraged to see each person's strengths and recognizing what we can share with each other.\r\nThis program integrates the curriculum and encourages children to respond to their learning by working together on projects that they can then share. This helps develop social skills and encouraged children to have a greater understanding of how all things work together, not in isolation. \r\nWe encourage students to practice language skills through material focused on learning more about science or other subjects of interest. Our classroom library is very lacking and we need more books on a variety of topics and at varied reading levels.\r\nBy increasing our classroom library, students will be able to work with material readily available when the interest arises and not have to wait to go to the school or public library.",My students need a science library that they are able to read independently and that fits with their interests.
